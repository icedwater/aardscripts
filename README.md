# Aardscripts

Just messing around with various things for my personal [Aardwolf][mud] setup,
so I decided to share them in case anybody felt like poking around one day for
themselves.

I'm currently using tintin++ 2.01 and Python 3.x, so stuff here will have been
tested on/with those to my satisfaction and availability. If you have any idea
about how these things can be improved, feel free to submit a pull request and
I'll check it out.

Thanks in advance!
